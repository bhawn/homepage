    						<h4>A Little About Me</h4>
    						<p>
    							&emsp;Howdy, my name is Benjamin Hawn and I am a recently graduated Master of Computer Science student at 
    							<a href="https://www.tamu.edu/">Texas A&M University</a>. 
    							I created this web-page as a sort of homepage for my various projects and for those who might look me up. 
    							My goals for this site is to provide others general information about myself along with other more detailed information such as my resume, my email, and a closer look at who I am.  
    							If you missed it, you will find my resume and info about myself under the <a href="resume.html">"Resume"</a> section of this site. If you want to send me an email there's a link 
    							for it on the resume page as well. Thanks and Gig 'Em!
    						</p>
    						<h4>Even More About Me</h4>
    						<p>
    						    <!--Interests-->
    							&emsp;As I mentioned earlier, I am a recent graduate of Texas A&Ms Master of Computer Science program</a>. 
    							Although a little strange, I first got started into the subject back when I was 8 years old playing a web-based game called neopets. 
    							In this game everyone had their own homepage which you could customize using HTML which is where I was first introduced into any sort of programming.
    							Although at the time I didn't learn much, it still started my interest into the field.
    							From this initial interest, years later I would take high-school computer science classes, go to programming summer camp, graduate from Texas A&M with my bachelor of science in computer science, and finally graduate from Texas A&M with my Master of Computer Science degree.
